### Mission

The goal of this document is to summarize and provide discussion[^1] on @Zhang2021 and present the results to my lab group with a focus on constructs and operations as conceptualized by @Shadish2002

[^1]: get more practice with Quarto

### Overall Summary

The paper is 2 experimental studies where two groups of people where given two types of games to play action[^2] and non-action[^3] games

[^2]: first person shooters

[^3]: simulation games

The goal was to analyze the learning rate of various tests before and after playing video games to see how the learning rate changed. The paper found that people who played action videos games learned faster on new tests. @Zhang2021 refer to this as "learning to learn"

### Constructs Involved

|           | Operational Level                                                                                             | Construct Level            |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| Units     | Adults with normal vision, low play time on video games                                                       | People                     |
| Treatment | First Person Shooters vs Simulator Games                                                                      | Action games               |
| Outcome   | Learning Rate Parameter as defined as $\rho$ and $a$ for orientation and working memory learning respectively | Learning rate conceptually |
| Settings  | Individual's home for Treatment & Lab for Tests                                                               | Experimental Settings      |
